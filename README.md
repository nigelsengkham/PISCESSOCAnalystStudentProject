<h1>PISCES SOC Analyst, IT 360/450 Classes (Spring 2023 & Fall 2023) Green River College</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
As an operational SOC analyst during my cyber defense coursework, I gained hands-on experience monitoring and protecting local government networks in Washington State. My responsibilities included evaluating network traffic using time-domain and signature-based analytics to identify potential threats. When security incidents were confirmed, I promptly created tickets and notified local government customers to ensure swift action. Over the course of the program, I dedicated more than 50 hours to monitoring alerts, honing my skills in threat detection and incident response.
